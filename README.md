# LHR Management Dashboard

    - [ ] User login
    - [ ] User roles
    - [ ] User permissions
    - [ ] User management

- [ ] Financial management
    - [ ] Purchase requests, approval, tracking, and logging pipeline
    - [ ] Automated PHYLISS creation (Bulk Purchase Request sheet for ESL) 
    - [ ] Expenditure tracking
    - [ ] Donation (income) tracking

- [ ] Corporate Partner Management
    - [ ] Contact information
    - [ ] Sponsorship / Donation tracking
    - [ ] Message logging

- [ ] Inventory management (on a per-team basis)
    - [ ] Parts tracking
    - [ ] Consumables tracking


## Tech Stack
This app is built on a 3-tier architecture, with a React front-end, a Python/FastAPI backend, and a PostgreSQL database.
Documentation for these three components can be found here:
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)

Current plans are to host the application either on AWS or GCP, with a CI/CD pipeline to deploy changes to the application

## Application Architecture
The source code for the application is built in this monorepo, with two major divisions.
